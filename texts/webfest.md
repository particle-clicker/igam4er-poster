The CERN Summer Student Webfest is an annual hackathon at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Participants work on interesting new ideas over the weekend and create web applications that encourage the public to learn more about science and in particular about CERN, the LHC and physics. Students also explore humanitarian projects that involve web-based solutions, together with CERNâ€™s partner UNOSAT.
